POKEDEX IN REACT-NATIVE


This is a sample project to test my React-Native skills with the Open Pok√©mon API.

It was developed using React-Native with Expo.

To run it, just clone it to your local machine and run:


expo start 


From the root folder.

This is a WIP and open-source project so feel free to copy, fork or modify it in any way you want.
